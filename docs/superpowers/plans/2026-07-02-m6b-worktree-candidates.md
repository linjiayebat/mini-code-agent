# Governed Worktree Candidates Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use `executing-plans` to implement this plan task by task, `test-driven-development` for every behavior change, and `verification-before-completion` before release claims.

**Goal:** Add host-managed, no-checkout Git worktree leases in which a bounded implementation Subagent can make CAS-protected text edits, then persist an independently verified candidate that the parent may separately preview, approve, adopt, or discard.

**Architecture:** A new `mini_code_agent.worktrees` package owns immutable policy models, a byte-safe fixed-argv Git adapter, secure state storage, index-based materialization, mutation-ledger capture, candidate snapshotting, exact cleanup, and rollback-aware adoption. The child never receives Git, shell, MCP, Skills, Hooks, adoption, or delegation capabilities. Parent-repository mutation remains a separate high-risk Tool operation and is never performed by child completion.

**Tech Stack:** Python 3.12/3.13, Pydantic v2, `asyncio`, `subprocess` without a shell, SHA-256 canonical manifests, existing `AgentRuntime`, `WorkspaceBoundary`, Tool/Policy interfaces, pytest, Ruff, mypy, GitHub Actions.

## Non-Negotiable Invariants

- Model input supplies only an implementation task and reason. Lease IDs, candidate IDs, paths, repository identity, base SHA, profiles, limits, and Git argv are host-controlled.
- A lease starts from a clean, non-bare repository at an exact full HEAD and uses `git worktree add --detach --no-checkout --lock`.
- Materialization reads the parent index and Git object database. It never copies the parent working tree, ignored files, untracked files, credentials, caches, or virtual environments.
- The child can only read/search, perform CAS-protected Write/Edit operations, and optionally invoke one fixed governed test Tool.
- Candidate readiness requires an independent filesystem scan whose changed set and hash chains exactly match the host mutation ledger.
- Child completion persists evidence but does not mutate the parent checkout. Adoption and discard are separate high-risk parent Tools.
- Adoption preflights every path before the first parent write, revalidates immediately before applying, and rolls back in reverse order after partial I/O failure.
- Unsafe or ambiguous state fails closed. Dirty unsnapshotted leases are retained for diagnosis rather than force-removed.

## Final Verification Commands

```powershell
py -m uv run --no-sync ruff format --check .
py -m uv run --no-sync ruff check .
py -m uv run --no-sync mypy src
py -m uv run --no-sync pytest -q
py -m uv build
git status --short
```

Run the full test suite and artifact smoke matrix under both supported Python versions. Do not claim completion from focused tests alone.

## Plan Self-Review

- The plan preserves the accepted two-phase security model: child work creates evidence; a separate approved Tool mutates the parent.
- Git interaction is intentionally narrower than the existing general command abstraction because index blobs and hostile paths require byte-safe, NUL-delimited handling.
- Candidate verification does not trust the child transcript or ledger alone; it reconciles the complete materialized tree, immutable base manifest, and ordered mutation hash chains.
- Adoption is process-serialized and rollback-aware, not described as crash-atomic. Recovery explicitly handles interrupted `applying` state.
- The first release supports one implementation child per delegation Tool call. The manager still enforces the accepted global active-lease ceiling, allowing independent parent calls without introducing multi-child adoption ambiguity.
- The release task includes code, tests, learning material, resume material, reproducible artifacts, CI, tag, release, and evidence rather than treating documentation as a later add-on.
