## L0 Notes

- `uv` owns the project interpreter, lock file, and reproducible commands.
- A `src` layout prevents tests from accidentally importing the repository directory.
- Pydantic validates runtime boundaries; Pyright checks internal contracts statically.
- Configuration precedence is explicit and tested.
- Logging applies recursive sensitive-field masking and configured-secret value scrubbing.
- On Windows, `python -m uv` works when the user Scripts directory is absent from `PATH`.
- TDD requires observing the expected failure before adding production behavior.

## L0 Review Lessons

- Validation errors are output channels too. Pydantic uses `hide_input_in_errors=True`, and
  environment parsing is normalized into the same application error type.
- Masking sensitive field names is insufficient. Configured secret values must also be removed
  from log messages, mapping keys, non-JSON objects, structured data, and exception text.
- A writable path is not automatically a usable data directory. Health checks must distinguish
  a directory from a regular file and stop at the nearest existing filesystem entry.
- `uv.lock` controls project dependencies, while isolated build dependencies need separate,
  hashed build constraints.
- A packaging smoke test must invoke the installed console script; calling the in-process Typer
  object cannot prove entry-point metadata is correct.

## L0 Verification

- Verified on 2026-06-29 with uv-managed Python 3.13.14 on Windows 11.
- `uv lock --check` and `uv sync --locked --all-groups`: passed.
- Ruff format/check and Pyright strict mode: passed.
- Pytest: 25 passed, 1 skipped because Windows denied symlink creation; branch-aware package
  coverage: 92.96%.
- Hashed Hatchling build produced wheel and source distribution.
- Both artifacts passed isolated, installed console-script smoke tests.
- `mini-code-agent doctor --json` reported healthy and did not expose an injected API key.
- GitHub Windows/Linux matrix: pending until the repository is pushed and Actions runs.

## L1/L2 Notes

- `Protocol` plays the role of a Java interface without forcing inheritance.
- Frozen Pydantic models are validated immutable DTOs at model, tool, and provider boundaries.
- The Agent Loop is an explicit state machine with hard turn, ToolCall, and timeout limits; it
  is not an unbounded `while` loop.
- ToolCall IDs act like correlation IDs: each executed call produces exactly one result with the
  same ID.
- Multi-call batches are preflighted before execution, preventing partial side effects when a
  later call is duplicated or over budget.
- Tool arguments and schemas use recursively immutable JSON views for deterministic replay while
  Pydantic serializers preserve standard JSON wire formats.
- M1 rejects write, execute, and network tool definitions; this declaration is enforced by the
  Runtime rather than trusted as documentation.
- Lifecycle events are best-effort observability: a sink failure cannot abort the run or mask
  cancellation.
- `ScriptedProvider` is analogous to a deterministic test double for an external service and
  enables full-loop tests without network calls or API keys.
- Cancellation is recorded and re-raised instead of swallowed, preserving asyncio structured
  concurrency semantics.
- Provider adapters own vendor message conversion and public error normalization; they cannot
  execute tools.

## M1 Local Verification

- Package version: `0.2.0a0`; milestone tag target: `v0.2.0-alpha.0`.
- uv-managed Python 3.13.14 project environment and isolated Python 3.12.13 on Windows 11.
- M1-focused tests: 48 passed.
- Full repository: 73 passed, 1 skipped because Windows denied symlink creation.
- Branch-aware package coverage: 95.82%.
- Ruff format/check and strict Pyright: passed.
- Hashed build plus isolated wheel/sdist console-script smoke: passed.
- Bandit source scan: no findings; pip-audit locked runtime dependencies: no known vulnerabilities.
- Real Anthropic and OpenAI-compatible adapters were intentionally deferred to M1b.

## M1b Provider Notes

- Anthropic and OpenAI-compatible use the same domain contract but different wire contracts.
  The Adapter is an anti-corruption layer, not a conditional branch in Agent Runtime.
- Anthropic puts `tool_use` and `tool_result` inside ordered content blocks. OpenAI-compatible
  Chat Completions uses assistant `tool_calls` plus separate `tool` role messages.
- Both providers stream tool arguments as partial JSON. The parser emits safe metadata-bearing
  deltas but waits for the terminal lifecycle before parsing a complete JSON object.
- OpenAI tool chunks are sparse: only the first chunk normally carries `id` and `name`.
  Per-index state makes later arguments fragments attributable and detects metadata changes.
- HTTPX async context managers guarantee response cleanup. The Adapter closes only internally
  created clients; injected clients are caller-owned.
- Public provider errors contain a normalized code, retryability, and a static message. Raw
  bodies, exception strings, payloads, and API keys stay behind the boundary.
- 401/403 are non-retryable authentication errors; 429, timeouts, and transient server/network
  failures are retryable classifications. The Adapter does not perform retries.
- Body and cumulative SSE data limits stop memory growth before parsing. Base URL and endpoint
  validation prevent credentials, query strings, fragments, traversal, and absolute endpoint
  substitution.
- `httpx.MockTransport` provides deterministic protocol tests without network access or secrets.
  It proves conversion and failure behavior, not live account availability.
- Chat Completions is the explicit compatibility profile. OpenAI Responses will be a separate
  future Adapter because its state and semantic event model differ.

## M1b Learning Exercises

1. Trace the two interleaved tool calls in
   `tests/unit/providers/test_openai_compatible.py` and record state by tool index.
2. Explain why Anthropic `tool_result` blocks must be moved before text in a mixed user message.
3. Add a malformed SSE lifecycle case as a failing test, then identify which invariant rejects it.
4. Compare `ProviderError.retryable` with Flink restart strategy: classification is input to a
   policy, not the retry policy itself.
5. Explain why a live API smoke test and a MockTransport contract test prove different things.

## M1b Local Verification

- Implemented programmatic Anthropic Messages and OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions adapters.
- Implemented non-streaming and SSE text/tool-call paths, usage and request-ID normalization.
- Provider-focused suite: 124 passed across shared transport, both adapters, Fake Provider, and
  cross-adapter integration contracts.
- The same unchanged `AgentRuntime` completes a real-wire-format ToolCall round trip through
  either adapter using credential-free mock HTTP responses.
- Full repository on Python 3.12.13 and 3.13.14: 191 passed per interpreter; 1 test skipped
  because the Windows account cannot create symlinks.
- Python 3.13 branch-aware package coverage: 89.91%, above the configured 85% gate.
- Ruff format/check and strict Pyright: passed.
- Bandit source scan: no findings. pip-audit: no known vulnerabilities; the unpublished local
  package itself was skipped because it is not on PyPI.
- Hashed build produced `mini_code_agent-0.3.0a0-py3-none-any.whl` and
  `mini_code_agent-0.3.0a0.tar.gz`.
- Wheel and sdist each passed isolated installed console-script smoke tests on Python 3.12 and
  3.13.
- Package version: `0.3.0a0`; local milestone tag target: `v0.3.0-alpha.0`.
- No live provider credential test or remote GitHub Actions result has been claimed.

## M2a Workspace and Registry Notes

- `resolve()` alone is not a security policy. The implementation first validates a
  platform-independent relative syntax, then rejects links/junctions, resolves strictly, and
  proves containment with path components.
- Cross-platform safety means rejecting forms that only become dangerous on another OS:
  drive-relative paths, UNC, alternate data streams, Windows device names, and trailing
  dots/spaces.
- `Path.relative_to(root)` is the containment proof. String prefix checks confuse roots such as
  `repo` and `repo-backup` and ignore platform case rules.
- `stat` checks metadata before open; `fstat` confirms the opened handle is a regular file.
  Reading `limit + 1` detects growth beyond the configured size.
- Strict UTF-8 and NUL rejection form an explicit text policy. The boundary preserves line
  endings so Read does not silently rewrite source representation.
- Traversal order is deterministic and bounded by file count, cumulative bytes, and depth.
  `.git` is excluded case-insensitively.
- JSON Schema validation happens in Registry before executor dispatch. Tools also validate direct
  calls, so bypassing Registry does not turn invalid arguments into filesystem operations.
- A definition is snapshotted once. Dynamic property changes cannot make advertised schema and
  dispatched implementation disagree.
- Literal search avoids model-controlled regex complexity. Unicode casefold positions are mapped
  back to original columns instead of reporting offsets in the expanded folded string.
- Read/Search use `asyncio.to_thread` so bounded disk work does not block the Agent event loop.
  Cancellation cannot kill a worker thread, but remaining work is read-only and budget-bounded.
- Workspace checks are not process isolation and do not eliminate TOCTOU if another process can
  mutate the tree. This limitation is explicit rather than hidden behind a “sandbox” claim.

## M2a Exercises

1. Explain why `C:secret.txt` is not an ordinary relative path on Windows.
2. Compare `resolve(strict=True)` with Java NIO `toRealPath()` and identify the race after check.
3. Add a new invalid JSON Schema to a test and trace why the tool never reaches `execute`.
4. Trace a file growing from exactly the limit to limit-plus-one during read.
5. Explain why `Straße NEEDLE`.casefold() changes offsets and how the position map repairs them.

## M2a Local Verification

- M2a-focused suite: 99 passed; 1 symlink test skipped because this Windows account cannot create
  symlinks.
- Full repository on Python 3.12.13 and 3.13.14: 290 passed per interpreter; 2 Windows symlink
  tests skipped per interpreter.
- Python 3.13 branch-aware package coverage: 90.33%, above the configured 85% gate.
- Ruff format/check and strict Pyright: passed.
- Bandit source scan: no findings. pip-audit: no known vulnerabilities; the unpublished local
  package itself was skipped because it is not on PyPI.
- Hashed build produced `mini_code_agent-0.4.0a0-py3-none-any.whl` and
  `mini_code_agent-0.4.0a0.tar.gz`.
- Wheel and sdist each passed isolated installed console-script smoke tests on Python 3.12 and
  3.13.
- Package version: `0.4.0a0`; local milestone tag target: `v0.4.0-alpha.0`.
- Linux symlink behavior still requires remote CI evidence; no remote result is claimed.

## M2b Policy and Governed Write Notes

- Permission is a control-plane decision outside the prompt. The model proposes a ToolCall but
  cannot turn `deny` into `allow` or approve its own `ask`.
- `GovernedToolExecutor` is analogous to a Spring interceptor: Schema validation, preview,
  policy, approval, and dispatch happen in a fixed order around tool execution.
- Ordered first-match rules are intentionally simple. Determinism and explainability are more
  valuable here than a hidden rule-merging algorithm.
- Non-interactive `ask` is denied before the approval handler. This prevents an accidentally
  permissive handler from converting unattended execution into implicit approval.
- `read_file` hashes complete raw bytes, including content outside a returned line window. The
  hash plays the role of a JPA optimistic-lock version.
- Existing writes require the exact hash; new writes are create-only. An approval therefore
  cannot silently authorize replacing a different ordinary snapshot.
- Edit requires exactly one literal match. This rejects ambiguous patches instead of guessing
  which occurrence the model intended.
- Same-directory temp files plus `os.replace` prevent partial replacement. They do not provide
  database isolation against a hostile concurrent external writer.
- Approval previews are bounded and contain only relative resources, static summary, bounded
  reason, risk, and diff. Approval is not code review or sandboxing.
- Blocking filesystem mutation runs through `asyncio.to_thread`, keeping the Agent event loop
  responsive while retaining strict byte and diff budgets.

## M2b Exercises

1. Trace one `edit_file` call from JSON Schema validation to the second hash check and list every
   point where it can fail without mutation.
2. Compare `expected_sha256` with JPA `@Version`: identify what both prevent and what filesystem
   replacement cannot guarantee.
3. Explain why an unattended `ask` must not call an auto-approve handler.
4. Change a file after preview but before execute and verify that execution returns `conflict`.
5. Explain why `os.replace` prevents partial content but not the final-check race.

## M2b Local Verification

- Governed-write focused tests: 32 unit tests plus 3 end-to-end integration tests passed.
- Full development suite on Python 3.12.13 and 3.13.14: 348 passed per interpreter; 2 Windows
  symlink privilege skips per interpreter.
- Branch-aware package coverage: 90.35%, above the configured 85% gate.
- Ruff format/check and strict Pyright: passed.
- Bandit source scan: no findings. pip-audit: no known vulnerabilities; the unpublished local
  package itself was skipped because it is not on PyPI.
- Hashed build produced `mini_code_agent-0.5.0a0-py3-none-any.whl` and
  `mini_code_agent-0.5.0a0.tar.gz`.
- Wheel and sdist each passed isolated installed console-script smoke tests on Python 3.12 and
  3.13.
- Package version: `0.5.0a0`; local milestone tag target: `v0.5.0-alpha.0`.
- Linux behavior and remote GitHub Actions still require remote evidence; no remote result is
  claimed.

## M2c Governed Command Notes

- An argv array is data passed directly to an executable. A shell string is a program in a
  second language with interpolation, expansion, redirects, and platform-specific quoting.
- `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec` corresponds to Java `ProcessBuilder(List<String>)`; avoiding
  `shell=True` removes shell parsing but does not make the executable safe.
- Coroutine cancellation does not automatically own an OS process. The runner must terminate the
  process tree, close/drain pipes, await the process, and only then propagate cancellation.
- Stdout and stderr share a retained-byte budget. After overflow, readers continue discarding
  bytes until termination so pipe backpressure cannot deadlock cleanup.
- A minimal environment prevents accidental API-key inheritance. It cannot stop a process from
  opening credential files under the same OS identity.
- Execute defaults to deny. An explicit rule can narrow tool, cwd, risk, session, trust source,
  and submitted executable; interactive `ask` still requires approval.
- POSIX process groups and Windows `taskkill /T /F` are lifecycle boundaries. They are not
  containers, restricted identities, or sandboxes.
- Non-zero exit is command data, while spawn/I/O/cleanup failures are infrastructure errors. This
  is analogous to distinguishing Flink task result, timeout, and TaskManager failure.

## M2c Exercises

1. Explain why `["python", "-m", "pytest"]` has different parsing semantics from a shell string.
2. Trace timeout from `asyncio.wait` through process-tree termination and pipe draining.
3. Explain why stopping capture at 1 MiB without draining can deadlock `process.wait`.
4. Compare coroutine cancellation, Java Future cancellation, and OS process termination.
5. List what minimal environment and cwd validation prevent, then list what requires a sandbox.

## M2c Local Verification

- Command/Policy/Tool focused suite: 70 passed after final cleanup hardening.
- Full Python 3.12.13 and 3.13.14 development suite: 395 passed per interpreter; 3 Windows
  symlink privilege skips per interpreter.
- Branch-aware package coverage: 89.73%, above the configured 85% gate.
- Ruff format/check and strict Pyright: passed.
- Bandit: no unsuppressed findings; the deliberate `subprocess` constants import has a scoped
  B404 suppression while execution remains argv-only. pip-audit found no known vulnerabilities;
  the unpublished local package itself was skipped because it is not on PyPI.
- Hashed build produced `mini_code_agent-0.6.0a0-py3-none-any.whl` and
  `mini_code_agent-0.6.0a0.tar.gz`.
- Wheel and sdist each passed isolated installed console-script smoke tests on Python 3.12 and
  3.13.
- Package version: `0.6.0a0`; local milestone tag target: `v0.6.0-alpha.0`.
- Linux process behavior and remote GitHub Actions still require remote evidence; no remote
  result is claimed.

## M3a Deterministic Context Budget Notes

- `ContextManager` is request admission control. `AgentRuntime` still owns the complete in-memory
  transcript, while each Provider sees only a validated `ContextWindow`.
- `Utf8TokenEstimator` counts canonical request JSON bytes plus framing. It is deterministic and
  provider-neutral, but is not an exact tokenizer and does not justify a token-savings claim.
- The first user goal and newest completed unit are required. ToolCall and ToolResult batches are
  correlated by ID sets and selected or omitted together.
- Only all-read-only exchanges are optional. Write, execute, network, mixed, and unknown-tool
  exchanges are pinned because erasing action evidence can cause a fresh-ID repeat.
- Optional history is retained as a newest contiguous suffix; pinned exchanges remain in original
  order even across omitted read-only history.
- A static omission marker records bounded counts and SHA-256 of the complete canonical
  transcript. The hash supports identity/equality evidence, not recovery, authentication, or
  Secret protection.
- Fixed goal overflow, latest-unit overflow, and pinned-history overflow are distinct internal
  failures. Runtime exposes one static context-limit message and makes no Provider call.
- `ContextCompacted` is best-effort observability. Event-sink failure cannot change request
  selection.
- M3a has no rolling model summary, artifact externalization, durable Session, or crash recovery.

## M3a Exercises

1. Trace budgets 609, 610, and 611 through `test_compaction_keeps_a_contiguous_recent_suffix_at_boundaries`.
2. Explain why a completed `write_file` exchange must remain visible even when its ToolCall ID
   cannot repeat.
3. Change a historical tool name to one absent from current definitions and explain the fail-safe
   classification.
4. Compare the complete `AgentResult.messages` with the third Provider request in the large-result
   integration test.
5. Explain why observed Provider usage cannot predict the next request and why the estimator is
   injected.

## M3a Current Verification

- Context manager unit suite: 18 passed.
- Context, Runtime, and context integration suite: 77 passed.
- Ruff and strict Pyright passed after binding Pyright to the worktree Python 3.13 environment.
- Full dual-Python, coverage, security, build, and artifact smoke evidence is recorded only after
  the `v0.7.0-alpha.0` release gate completes.
