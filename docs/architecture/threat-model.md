# Threat Model

## Protected Assets

- User source code and uncommitted changes.
- Files outside the selected workspace.
- API keys and environment secrets.
- Git history and repository integrity.
- Session, checkpoint, and trace integrity.

## Untrusted Inputs

- Model output and ToolCall arguments.
- Repository files and instructions.
- Skills, hooks, and project configuration.
- MCP servers and their tool results.
- Command output and generated patches.

## Initial Controls

- Secret-safe settings and recursive log redaction.
- Explicit configuration precedence.
- No tool execution in M0.
- Side-effecting tools must pass Schema, Workspace, Policy, preview, and approval checks.
- Trace data must be size-limited and redacted.
- M2a read-only tools pass Draft 2020-12 Schema validation and one WorkspaceBoundary.
- Model paths reject cross-platform traversal, link/junction, `.git`, ADS/device, type, size,
  binary, and encoding hazards.
- Workspace traversal and ToolResult content have explicit resource limits.
- M2b write tools use bounded previews, interactive-only approval for `ask`, SHA-256
  preconditions, create-only publication, and same-directory atomic replacement.
- Non-interactive `ask` decisions fail closed without invoking an approval handler.
- M2c commands use argv-only execution, workspace cwd validation, a minimal inherited
  environment, bounded output/time, and process-tree cleanup.
- Execute remains denied by default and requires an explicit tool/executable policy rule.
- M3a applies deterministic request admission before every provider call, keeps ToolCall and
  ToolResult batches atomic, and fails before provider I/O when required context cannot fit.
- Completed write/execute/network and unknown-tool exchanges remain pinned during compaction so
  the model does not lose in-memory evidence of an action and repeat it under a new call ID.
- Compaction markers/events contain bounded counts and a transcript fingerprint, not raw omitted
  content.
- M3b stores only bounded typed lifecycle metadata in SQLite schema version 1; prompts, ToolCall
  arguments, ToolResults, patches, and command output are excluded.
- Required Journal writes precede Provider/Tool work. `ToolStarted` is durable before execution,
  and persistence failure stops all later work with static errors.
- SQLite append and Session/Run projection updates share one `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction with
  WAL, foreign keys, full synchronous writes, bounded busy timeout, and parameterized SQL.
- Event IDs provide exact-payload idempotency. Per-Session sequence and SHA-256 chains detect
  inconsistent rows and projections.
- Explicitly configured Secret values are scrubbed from bounded free-form stop errors before
  hashing and storage.
- M4b test execution uses a host-owned Pytest profile; the model cannot select executables,
  arbitrary options, cwd, environment, timeout, plugins, or report paths.
- Test targets pass WorkspaceBoundary, execute policy, critical preview, and independent approval.
  Ambient plugin autoload and Pytest cache writes are disabled.
- Test time/output and JUnit bytes/cases/diagnostics/text are independently bounded. Reports reject
  unsafe file types, invalid UTF-8, DTD/entities, malformed XML, and contradictory outcomes.
- Pytest process status remains available when its report is missing or invalid; temporary report
  cleanup runs on every exit path.

## Non-claims

- Regex command filtering is not a sandbox.
- Workspace path checks are not process isolation.
- Workspace checks do not eliminate TOCTOU when another process can mutate the tree.
- Hash revalidation narrows but does not eliminate the race between final check and replacement.
- Human approval does not make malicious code safe.
- An approved local process can access host files, network, credentials in files, and other
  resources available to the current OS identity.
- Process groups and tree termination are lifecycle controls, not security isolation; hostile
  detached descendants require an OS sandbox.
- Context fingerprints are not encryption, authentication, redaction, or durable storage.
- M3a pinning reduces in-process repeat-action risk but does not provide crash-safe replay
  prevention or exactly-once side effects; those require M3b/M3c persistence and recovery.
- A provider-neutral UTF-8 estimator is not an exact vendor tokenizer and cannot guarantee
  provider acceptance.
- SQLite WAL/`synchronous=FULL` improve local durability but do not provide replication,
  distributed consistency, or protection from storage failure.
- The Trace hash chain is not signed or authenticated; a writer with database access can rewrite
  payloads and hashes.
- M3c Checkpoints persist full prompts, responses, Tool arguments/results, patches, and command
  output as bounded plaintext. Event Secret scrubbing does not protect Checkpoint payloads.
- Resume rejects Tool-contract or Workspace drift and scans all post-Checkpoint Trace events.
  Any uncheckpointed write, execute, or network Tool blocks automatic replay.
- Provider/read-only replay requires explicit policy and can still duplicate Provider cost or
  observations. No exactly-once or external-system reconciliation is claimed.
- SQLite serializes local Checkpoint claims; it is not a multi-host lease service.
- Read-only Git commands can execute repository-configured fsmonitor, external diff, textconv, or
  submodule behavior unless explicitly disabled. M4a fixes command templates and tests that these
  extension points do not run.
- Git status/diff can contain credentials or proprietary source and are sent to the model as Tool
  results. Their hashes provide identity, not confidentiality or authenticity.
- `--no-optional-locks` prevents optional index refresh, but Git evidence remains a stale-able
  observation under concurrent filesystem mutation.
- An approved Pytest run executes repository tests, `conftest.py`, and host-trusted plugins with
  the Agent OS identity. Fixed argv, minimal environment, approval, and resource limits are not a
  filesystem, process, credential, or network sandbox.
- JUnit is untrusted because test code can tamper with its report. Bounded parsing does not prove
  report provenance or prevent tests from exfiltrating data through stdout/stderr.
- Exact managed-report path/name echoes are replaced before ToolResult serialization, but hostile
  tests can encode or transform the value; output replacement is not a data-loss-prevention
  boundary.
- Disabling `.pytest_cache` prevents a harness-created cache only; project tests may still modify
  the Workspace or host.
- Lifecycle Trace excludes test payloads, but stable Checkpoints contain complete bounded
  ToolResults as plaintext.
- Configured-value scrubbing cannot detect unknown secrets, and SQLite is not encrypted at rest.
- MCP connection does not establish trust.
