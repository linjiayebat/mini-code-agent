# Governed MCP Stdio

## Purpose

M5b connects explicitly approved local MCP servers without allowing MCP discovery to create Agent
authority. It supports one transport and one server feature:

- direct local `stdio`;
- MCP Tools.

It uses the official stable Python SDK `mcp>=1.28.1,<2` and protocol `2025-11-25`. Streamable
HTTP, SSE, OAuth, Resources, Prompts, Roots, Sampling, Elicitation, Tasks, server instructions,
dynamic Tool refresh, automatic retry, and package installation are outside this release.

## Two Authority Decisions

Starting an MCP server and calling one of its Tools are different decisions:

1. **Connection approval** authorizes one exact local executable/argv/cwd/environment-name set to
   start with the Agent user's operating-system privileges.
2. **Tool governance** evaluates one validated `ToolCall` through ActionPreview, Hooks, Policy,
   and optional Tool approval.

Connection approval never means every Tool call is approved.

## Host-Pinned Profile

`McpServerProfile` is trusted composition data. It is never loaded from a repository, Skill,
model response, server response, registry, or discovered configuration file.

The profile pins:

- stable `server_id`;
- absolute existing executable regular-file path;
- exact argument tuple;
- absolute existing unlinked working directory;
- up to 32 explicit environment keys with `SecretStr` values;
- exact protocol, server name, and server version;
- one to 32 `McpToolGrant` records;
- startup, listing, call, close, schema, Tool-count, text, JSON, and result limits.

The executable and cwd are checked at model construction and revalidated immediately before
process creation. Links, Windows reparse points, relative paths, missing paths, non-regular
executables, and non-executable files fail closed. Argument tokens are passed as data; no command
string, shell expansion, PATH resolution, or URL opener is used.

Environment values remain `SecretStr`. Approval exposes only sorted key names. The official SDK
adds its small platform-default environment allowlist and the explicit profile values.

## Exact Tool Contracts

Every `McpToolGrant` binds:

- exact case-sensitive remote name;
- bounded local Agent alias;
- host-owned model-facing description;
- host-owned `SideEffect` and `RiskLevel`;
- canonical input-schema SHA-256;
- optional canonical output-schema SHA-256.

Server title, description, icons, annotations, metadata, instructions, and destructive/read-only
hints are ignored. They cannot change Policy authority or model-facing definitions.

After initialization, the client requires:

- exact protocol version;
- exact server name/version;
- Tools capability;
- `tools.listChanged` disabled;
- one non-paginated Tool page;
- unique observed names;
- exact equality between observed Tool names and grants;
- valid bounded JSON Schemas with matching canonical hashes;
- no task-required Tool.

One missing, unexpected, duplicate, renamed, paginated, or drifted Tool rejects the entire
connection. No partial Registry is published.

Canonical hashes use sorted-key compact ASCII JSON with non-finite numbers rejected. A hash proves
equality with the reviewed contract, not code provenance or safe behavior.

## SDK and Process Lifecycle

The production `OfficialStdioSessionFactory` keeps `stdio_client` and `ClientSession` inside a
dedicated asyncio owner worker. This is required because the SDK's AnyIO contexts must exit in the
task that entered them. Public calls can originate in another task; `aclose()` signals the worker,
which performs protocol transport shutdown and process-tree cleanup in the owner task.

```text
new -> approving -> connecting -> verifying -> ready -> closing -> closed
                         \---------- failure ----------/
```

`McpStdioClient` is single-use. Calls are serialized and never retried. Startup, initialize,
listing, call, and close have separate deadlines. A timeout, cancellation, or raw transport
failure closes the session and makes later calls unavailable.

For a read-only timeout the public code is `mcp_tool_timeout`. For WRITE, EXECUTE, or NETWORK,
timeout returns `mcp_tool_completion_unknown`: cancellation stops waiting but cannot prove the
remote side effect did not happen.

Server stderr goes to `os.devnull`. This prevents unbounded log capture and secret propagation but
reduces diagnostics.

## Result Boundary

The SDK adapter accepts only:

- ordered text blocks;
- optional object-shaped `structuredContent`;
- `isError`.

Image, audio, resource-link, embedded-resource, and unknown content reject the entire result.
Annotations and `_meta` are not retained. Global SDK snapshot ceilings apply before profile-level
limits.

`McpTool` then enforces:

- block count and aggregate text characters;
- total UTF-8 result bytes;
- JSON depth and node count;
- string/key bounds and finite numbers;
- granted output schema for successful results.

Remote business errors keep bounded text and `is_error=true` so the model can correct arguments.
Oversized or unsupported data is never truncated into success.

The final model-visible shape is deterministic:

```json
{
  "content_type": "mcp_tool_result",
  "server_id": "local-git",
  "structured_content": {"clean": true},
  "text": ["clean"],
  "tool": "status"
}
```

## Governance Composition

```python
from mini_code_agent.mcp import McpStdioClient, build_mcp_tools
from mini_code_agent.policy import GovernedToolExecutor, TrustSource
from mini_code_agent.tools import ToolRegistry

async with McpStdioClient(profile, approver=connection_approver) as client:
    mcp_tools = build_mcp_tools(client)
    all_tools = (*native_tools, *mcp_tools)
    executor = GovernedToolExecutor(
        ToolRegistry(all_tools),
        policy=policy,
        approval=tool_approval,
        session_mode=session_mode,
        trust_source=TrustSource.MODEL,
        trust_sources={
            tool.definition.name: TrustSource.EXTENSION
            for tool in mcp_tools
        },
    )
    result = await agent_runtime(provider, executor).run(
        user_prompt="Inspect the project."
    )
```

Per-Tool provenance is copied at executor construction. Unknown mapping keys and non-enum values
are rejected. MCP ActionPreview resources use
`mcp://<server_id>/tools/<remote_name>` and host-selected risk/side effect.

## Failure Matrix

| Boundary | Failure | Public outcome |
|---|---|---|
| Approval | deny, timeout, exception, malformed result | no process; `connection_not_approved` |
| Launch path | relative, missing, linked, reparse, replaced | no process; `connection_failed` |
| Initialize | timeout, protocol/identity mismatch, no Tools | close; typed connection error |
| Tool list | pagination, dynamic flag, extra/missing/duplicate Tool | close; no definitions |
| Schema | invalid, oversized, hash drift | close; no definitions |
| Policy | deny or rejected ask | no remote Tool call; `permission_denied` |
| Remote call | timeout/transport failure | close; timeout or completion unknown |
| Result | unsupported, invalid, oversized, schema mismatch | static Tool error; no partial content |
| Close | budget or SDK failure | `close_failed`; client is unusable |

## Operational Verification

The real integration fixture uses the official low-level SDK over stdio. It proves:

- exact handshake, identity, schemas, call, structured output, and shutdown;
- connection approval projection excludes environment values;
- `TrustSource.EXTENSION` Policy deny prevents a remote call;
- Tool ASK remains independent from connection approval;
- an extra Tool or changed schema admits no definitions;
- the official session can close from a different caller task without leaking a Windows transport.

## Threat Boundary and Non-Claims

- MCP is interoperability, not a sandbox or trust protocol.
- A local server can execute arbitrary code during startup before any Tool call.
- `stdio` restricts protocol access to the child pipes; it does not restrict filesystem, network,
  process, or credential access available to the child.
- Approval displays the launch facts; it does not make an executable safe.
- Host `READ_ONLY` is an assertion about intended behavior, not enforcement inside server code.
- Schema hashes detect contract drift, not implementation drift, package substitution, or
  malicious behavior behind the same schema.
- Revalidating paths narrows ordinary TOCTOU but cannot make process launch atomic with file
  identity on every operating system.
- Timeout and process cleanup cannot roll back a side effect.
- M5b does not verify executable signatures or argument-file hashes and does not install packages.
- M5b does not implement remote MCP, OAuth, Resources, Prompts, Roots, Sampling, Elicitation,
  Tasks, dynamic Tool updates, retries, durable MCP lifecycle audit, or OS isolation.
