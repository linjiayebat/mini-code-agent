# Mini CodeAgent

A framework-light, provider-neutral coding agent built from first principles.

> Status: pre-alpha. M4b provides a provider-neutral Agent Core, Anthropic/OpenAI-compatible
> adapters, a schema-validating Tool Registry, a cross-platform Workspace boundary, bounded
> Read/Search, conflict-aware Write/Edit, policy-governed argv command execution, and deterministic
> context admission, hardened read-only Git evidence, governed Pytest diagnostics, versioned SQLite
> Session/Trace persistence, and fail-closed Checkpoint/Resume. Automatic repair, OS sandboxing,
> shell-string execution, and live-provider CI are not implemented.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12 or 3.13
- uv 0.11.25

## Development

```powershell
uv sync --all-groups
uv run mini-code-agent --version
uv run mini-code-agent doctor
uv run pytest
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run ruff check .
uv run pyright
uv build --build-constraint build-constraints.txt --require-hashes
```

If `uv` was installed by `pip` but is not available on the Windows `PATH`, use
`python -m uv` in the commands above.

## Configuration

Precedence is:

```text
defaults < TOML file < MINI_CODE_AGENT_* environment variables < CLI overrides
```

Default config paths follow the operating system conventions provided by Platformdirs.
Secrets are accepted from environment variables but are never printed by `doctor`.
See `config.example.toml` for supported inputs.

## Provider Adapters

Both adapters implement the same `ModelProvider` protocol:

```python
from pydantic import SecretStr

from mini_code_agent.providers import (
    AnthropicProvider,
    OpenAICompatibleProvider,
)

anthropic = AnthropicProvider(
    api_key=SecretStr("..."),
    model="your-claude-model",
)

compatible = OpenAICompatibleProvider(
    api_key=SecretStr("..."),
    model="your-model",
    base_url="https://your-provider.example/v1",
)
```

Applications must call `await provider.aclose()` for internally created clients. Injected
`httpx.AsyncClient` instances remain caller-owned. M1b tests use `httpx.MockTransport`; no live
API success is claimed without a separate credentialed smoke test.

## Read-only Workspace

```python
from pathlib import Path

from mini_code_agent.tools import ReadFileTool, SearchTextTool, ToolRegistry
from mini_code_agent.workspace import WorkspaceBoundary

workspace = WorkspaceBoundary(Path.cwd())
tools = ToolRegistry([
    ReadFileTool(workspace),
    SearchTextTool(workspace),
])
```

Model paths must be workspace-relative POSIX-style paths. The boundary rejects links, `.git`,
cross-platform special path forms, non-regular/binary/non-UTF-8 files, and resource-limit
violations. This is a filesystem policy, not an OS sandbox.

## Governed Writes

Side-effecting tools must be composed through `GovernedToolExecutor`. The secure defaults allow
reads, ask for interactive approval on writes, and deny execute/network actions. Existing files
require the SHA-256 returned by `read_file`; new files use create-only semantics.

See `docs/architecture/governed-writes.md` for the complete composition and concurrency limits.

## Governed Commands

`run_command` uses explicit argv and never `shell=True`. Execute is denied by default and requires
an explicit policy rule. The runner validates cwd, strips arbitrary environment variables, bounds
time/output, and cleans process trees on timeout, overflow, or cancellation.

This is local process lifecycle control, not an OS sandbox. See
`docs/architecture/governed-command-execution.md`.

## Context Budget

Every provider request is estimated before network I/O. Compaction keeps the original goal,
newest completed unit, and all side-effecting or unknown-tool exchanges; ToolCall and ToolResult
batches remain atomic. Older read-only history may be omitted with bounded count/fingerprint
evidence. If required history cannot fit, the run stops without calling the provider.

The default UTF-8 estimator is deterministic and provider-neutral, not an exact vendor tokenizer.
M3a is not durable memory or crash-safe replay prevention. See
`docs/architecture/context-budget.md`.

## Session and Trace

```python
from pathlib import Path

from mini_code_agent.agent.runtime import AgentRuntime
from mini_code_agent.persistence import SqliteSessionTraceStore

with SqliteSessionTraceStore(Path("agent-state.db")) as store:
    session = store.create_session()
    runtime = AgentRuntime(
        provider,
        tools,
        journal=store.journal(session.session_id),
    )
    result = await runtime.run(user_prompt="Inspect the project.")
    verification = store.verify_trace(session.session_id)
```

SQLite database schema v2 stores bounded Trace-envelope-v1 lifecycle events, Checkpoints, and
Session/Run projections in transactional boundaries.
The required journal records `ModelStarted` before Provider I/O and `ToolStarted` before Tool
execution; a persistence failure stops later work. Event IDs are idempotency keys, and a
per-Session SHA-256 chain detects inconsistent rows and projections.

Trace events exclude prompts, Tool arguments/results, patches, and command output. The hash chain
is not signed or tamper-proof. See
`docs/architecture/session-trace.md`.

## Checkpoint and Resume

M3c saves full typed state only before Provider calls: initially and after complete ToolResult
batches. SQLite schema v2 atomically binds each snapshot to `CheckpointSaved`. Resume verifies the
Trace, Tool contract, and bounded Workspace fingerprint, then explicitly gates possible
Provider/read-only replay. Any uncheckpointed write, execute, or network action blocks automatic
Resume.

Checkpoint payloads contain full prompts, model text, Tool arguments/results, and command output
as bounded plaintext. This is local crash recovery, not encryption, distributed coordination, or
exactly-once external execution. Keep the database outside the model-controlled Workspace. See
`docs/architecture/checkpoint-resume.md`.

## Read-only Git

`git_status` parses bounded `--porcelain=v2 -z` output into typed branch and file entries.
`git_diff` returns a bounded staged or unstaged patch. The Workspace must be the exact repository
top-level.

The client disables paging, optional locks, fsmonitor, external diff, textconv, and submodule
recursion. It never exposes model-controlled Git argv and does not provide add/commit/reset/
checkout/push. Git evidence may contain source code or secrets and is a point-in-time observation.
See `docs/architecture/readonly-git.md`.

## Governed Pytest

`run_tests` executes a host-configured Pytest profile. The model can provide only optional existing
workspace-relative files/directories and a reason; it cannot choose the Python executable, cwd,
plugins, timeout, report path, environment, or arbitrary options.

The fixed argv uses isolated Python startup, disables ambient plugin autoload and `.pytest_cache`,
places `--` before targets, and converts bounded built-in JUnit XML into typed process/report
statuses, counts, and diagnostics. Execute remains denied by default and requires an explicit
policy rule plus approval.

Approved tests still run arbitrary repository code with the Agent process's OS permissions. This
is governed execution, not a sandbox or an automatic Repair Loop. See
`docs/architecture/governed-test-execution.md`.
