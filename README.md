# Mini CodeAgent

A framework-light, provider-neutral coding agent built from first principles.

> Status: pre-alpha. M3b provides a provider-neutral Agent Core, Anthropic/OpenAI-compatible
> adapters, a schema-validating Tool Registry, a cross-platform Workspace boundary, bounded
> Read/Search, conflict-aware Write/Edit, policy-governed argv command execution, and deterministic
> context admission plus versioned SQLite Session/Trace persistence. Shell-string execution,
> Checkpoint/Resume, and live-provider CI are not implemented.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12 or 3.13
- uv 0.11.25

## Development

```powershell
uv sync --all-groups
uv run mini-code-agent --version
uv run mini-code-agent doctor
uv run pytest
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run ruff check .
uv run pyright
uv build --build-constraint build-constraints.txt --require-hashes
```

If `uv` was installed by `pip` but is not available on the Windows `PATH`, use
`python -m uv` in the commands above.

## Configuration

Precedence is:

```text
defaults < TOML file < MINI_CODE_AGENT_* environment variables < CLI overrides
```

Default config paths follow the operating system conventions provided by Platformdirs.
Secrets are accepted from environment variables but are never printed by `doctor`.
See `config.example.toml` for supported inputs.

## Provider Adapters

Both adapters implement the same `ModelProvider` protocol:

```python
from pydantic import SecretStr

from mini_code_agent.providers import (
    AnthropicProvider,
    OpenAICompatibleProvider,
)

anthropic = AnthropicProvider(
    api_key=SecretStr("..."),
    model="your-claude-model",
)

compatible = OpenAICompatibleProvider(
    api_key=SecretStr("..."),
    model="your-model",
    base_url="https://your-provider.example/v1",
)
```

Applications must call `await provider.aclose()` for internally created clients. Injected
`httpx.AsyncClient` instances remain caller-owned. M1b tests use `httpx.MockTransport`; no live
API success is claimed without a separate credentialed smoke test.

## Read-only Workspace

```python
from pathlib import Path

from mini_code_agent.tools import ReadFileTool, SearchTextTool, ToolRegistry
from mini_code_agent.workspace import WorkspaceBoundary

workspace = WorkspaceBoundary(Path.cwd())
tools = ToolRegistry([
    ReadFileTool(workspace),
    SearchTextTool(workspace),
])
```

Model paths must be workspace-relative POSIX-style paths. The boundary rejects links, `.git`,
cross-platform special path forms, non-regular/binary/non-UTF-8 files, and resource-limit
violations. This is a filesystem policy, not an OS sandbox.

## Governed Writes

Side-effecting tools must be composed through `GovernedToolExecutor`. The secure defaults allow
reads, ask for interactive approval on writes, and deny execute/network actions. Existing files
require the SHA-256 returned by `read_file`; new files use create-only semantics.

See `docs/architecture/governed-writes.md` for the complete composition and concurrency limits.

## Governed Commands

`run_command` uses explicit argv and never `shell=True`. Execute is denied by default and requires
an explicit policy rule. The runner validates cwd, strips arbitrary environment variables, bounds
time/output, and cleans process trees on timeout, overflow, or cancellation.

This is local process lifecycle control, not an OS sandbox. See
`docs/architecture/governed-command-execution.md`.

## Context Budget

Every provider request is estimated before network I/O. Compaction keeps the original goal,
newest completed unit, and all side-effecting or unknown-tool exchanges; ToolCall and ToolResult
batches remain atomic. Older read-only history may be omitted with bounded count/fingerprint
evidence. If required history cannot fit, the run stops without calling the provider.

The default UTF-8 estimator is deterministic and provider-neutral, not an exact vendor tokenizer.
M3a is not durable memory or crash-safe replay prevention. See
`docs/architecture/context-budget.md`.

## Session and Trace

```python
from pathlib import Path

from mini_code_agent.agent.runtime import AgentRuntime
from mini_code_agent.persistence import SqliteSessionTraceStore

with SqliteSessionTraceStore(Path("agent-state.db")) as store:
    session = store.create_session()
    runtime = AgentRuntime(
        provider,
        tools,
        journal=store.journal(session.session_id),
    )
    result = await runtime.run(user_prompt="Inspect the project.")
    verification = store.verify_trace(session.session_id)
```

SQLite schema v1 stores bounded lifecycle events and Session/Run projections in one transaction.
The required journal records `ModelStarted` before Provider I/O and `ToolStarted` before Tool
execution; a persistence failure stops later work. Event IDs are idempotency keys, and a
per-Session SHA-256 chain detects inconsistent rows and projections.

Prompts, Tool arguments/results, patches, and command output are not stored. The hash chain is not
signed or tamper-proof, and active/started-only state cannot be resumed until M3c. See
`docs/architecture/session-trace.md`.
